**Project Overview**
This capstone project presents an AI Research Agent designed to assist researchers, students, and professionals in navigating the vast and ever-evolving landscape of academic publications and research trends. The agent aims to solve the problem of manually reviewing, filtering, and synthesizing information, which is often time-consuming and inefficient. By leveraging advanced technologies like Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), the agent provides a solution to streamline literature reviews, summarize papers, and identify research gaps.

**Key Features (Wow Factors)**
The AI Research Agent includes several unique features that make knowledge more accessible and actionable.

Semantic Search: Allows for semantic search across research papers, journals, and datasets.

Auto-summarization: Automatically summarizes selected papers.

Citation and Reference Analysis: Helps trace influence through citation and reference analysis.

Paper Recommendation: Recommends research papers based on a user’s current topic.

Trend Analysis: Analyzes trends over time for specific keywords or domains.

Collaboration Mapping: Suggests potential co-authors or institutions based on similar research interests.

**Technology Used**
The project was developed using a range of IBM technologies and other key components:

IBM Cloud Services: The agent utilizes IBM Cloud lite services, including IBM Cloud Watsonx AI Studio, IBM Cloud Watsonx AI runtime, and IBM Cloud Agent Lab.

Foundation Model: The IBM Granite foundation model is used.

Core Technologies: The agent's capabilities are built upon Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).

**End Users**
This AI Research Agent is designed to benefit a variety of users, including:

Academic Researchers

Research Institutions and Universities

Industry R&D Teams

Educators

**Results**
The implemented AI agent can generate reports, suggest hypotheses, and even draft sections of research papers. It saves time by automating repetitive tasks like citation management and data extraction. This enhances efficiency, accuracy, and innovation in both academic and industrial R&D. The project includes an "Agent preview" showing the agent responding to queries such as "Show me recent research on artificial intelligence" and "Give me a simple hypothesis about plants and sunlight."

**Future Scope**
The project has several potential areas for future development, including:

Multilingual Research Support

Voice-Activated Research Assistant

Real-Time Collaboration Features

Research Gap and Novel Topic Identification

Integration with Publishing Platforms

AI-Assisted Paper Drafting
